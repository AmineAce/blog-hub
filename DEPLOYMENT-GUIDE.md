# Blog Hub - Deployment & Content Management Guide

This guide will help you deploy your blog to GitHub and Netlify, and manage content through GitHub.

## 🚀 Initial Deployment Setup

### 1. GitHub Repository Setup

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub:**
   - Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and click "New repository"
   - Name it `blog-hub` (or your preferred name)
   - Make it **Public** (required for free Netlify deployment)
   - Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. **Initialize Git in your project:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Blog Hub with static export and image support"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/blog-hub.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 2. Netlify Deployment

1. **Connect to Netlify:**
   - Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up/login
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your GitHub account and select your `blog-hub` repository

2. **Configure Build Settings:**
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `out`
   - **Node version:** 18 (or latest LTS)

3. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site
   - You'll get a random URL like `https://amazing-blog-123456.netlify.app`

4. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - Go to Site settings → Domain management
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow Netlify's DNS configuration instructions

## 📝 Content Management Workflow

### Adding New Blog Posts

1. **Create a new markdown file:**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project
   cd blog-hub
   
   # Create a new post file
   touch posts/your-new-post-slug.md
   ```

2. **Write your blog post:**
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "Your Amazing Blog Post Title"
   date: "2024-01-20"
   excerpt: "A brief description of your post that will appear in listings"
   ---
   
   # Your Amazing Blog Post Title
   
   Write your content here using Markdown syntax...
   
   ## Subheading
   
   More content...
   ```

3. **Add an image (optional):**
   ```bash
   # Add your post image
   cp your-image.jpg public/images/posts/your-new-post-slug.jpg
   ```

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new blog post: Your Amazing Blog Post Title"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Automatic Deployment:**
   - Netlify will automatically detect the changes
   - It will rebuild and redeploy your site (usually takes 1-2 minutes)
   - Your new post will be live!

### Updating Existing Posts

1. **Edit the markdown file:**
   ```bash
   # Edit your post
   code posts/existing-post-slug.md
   ```

2. **Update the image (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Replace the image
   cp new-image.jpg public/images/posts/existing-post-slug.jpg
   ```

3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update blog post: Post Title"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Deleting Posts

1. **Remove the markdown file:**
   ```bash
   rm posts/post-to-delete.md
   ```

2. **Remove the image (if exists):**
   ```bash
   rm public/images/posts/post-to-delete.jpg
   ```

3. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove blog post: Post Title"
   git push origin main
   ```

## 🖼️ Image Management

### Supported Image Formats
- **JPG/JPEG** (recommended for photos)
- **PNG** (recommended for graphics with transparency)
- **WebP** (best compression, modern browsers)
- **GIF** (for animations)

### Image Naming Convention
- **File name must match post slug exactly**
- **Example:** Post slug `react-tutorial` → Image `react-tutorial.jpg`
- **Location:** `public/images/posts/`

### Image Optimization Tips
- **Recommended size:** 1200x630px for featured images
- **File size:** Keep under 500KB for better performance
- **Use WebP format** when possible for better compression

## 🔧 Local Development

### Running the Site Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

### Testing Before Deployment
```bash
# Build the site locally
npm run build

# Test the static export
npm run start
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails on Netlify:**
   - Check that all markdown files have proper frontmatter
   - Ensure image files are in the correct directory
   - Check the build logs in Netlify dashboard

2. **Images not showing:**
   - Verify image file name matches post slug exactly
   - Check file extension is supported
   - Ensure image is in `public/images/posts/` directory

3. **Date formatting issues:**
   - Use YYYY-MM-DD format in frontmatter
   - Example: `date: "2024-01-20"`

4. **Read time calculation:**
   - The system automatically calculates read time
   - Based on actual word count (excluding markdown syntax)
   - Average reading speed: 200 words per minute

### Getting Help

1. **Check Netlify build logs:**
   - Go to your site dashboard
   - Click on "Deploys" tab
   - Click on the failed deploy to see logs

2. **Test locally first:**
   - Always test changes locally with `npm run build`
   - Fix any issues before pushing to GitHub

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Writing Blog Posts
- Use descriptive, SEO-friendly titles
- Write compelling excerpts (appears in listings)
- Use proper markdown formatting
- Add images to make posts more engaging
- Keep posts focused and well-structured

### Git Workflow
- Make small, focused commits
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Test locally before pushing
- Use branches for major changes

### Performance

## 🔄 Automated Workflow

Once set up, your workflow becomes:

3. **Test locally** → `npm run dev`
4. **Commit & push** → `git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push`
5. **Auto-deploy** → Netlify builds and deploys automatically
6. **Live site** → Your changes are live in 1-2 minutes!
