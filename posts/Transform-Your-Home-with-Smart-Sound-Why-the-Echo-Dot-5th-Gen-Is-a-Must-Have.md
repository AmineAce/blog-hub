Smarter Alexa, Smarter Routines

Alexa is more intuitive than ever, with "vibrant helpful routines" that automate your dayâ€”like morning briefings with weather and news, or evening wind-downs with dimmed lights and lullabies. Set hands-free timers, control compatible smart devices, and get answers to thousands of questions, all with enhanced privacy via a built-in microphone off button.
