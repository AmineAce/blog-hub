Why You’ll Love the RØDE Wireless ME

RØDE has long been trusted by professionals, and the Wireless ME distills that expertise into an ultra-portable, user-friendly kit. Here’s what makes it stand out:

**All-in-One Simplicity**  
The system includes a compact transmitter with a built-in microphone and a receiver that plugs directly into your device via USB-C, Lightning, or 3.5mm—no extra adapters needed. It’s ready to use right out of the box.

**Crystal-Clear Audio**  
With a high-quality omnidirectional mic capsule and 24-bit/48kHz digital transmission, the Wireless ME captures rich, detailed sound while minimizing background noise. Perfect for outdoor shoots, indoor interviews, or even voiceovers.

**Compact & Camera-Mountable**  
Both the transmitter and receiver are lightweight and small enough to clip onto a lapel, bag strap, or camera hot shoe. The included foam windscreen helps reduce wind noise, making it ideal for on-the-move filming.

**Long Battery Life & Secure Connection**  
Enjoy up to 7 hours of continuous use on a single charge, and a stable wireless range of up to 200 meters (line of sight). The secure digital connection ensures no dropouts or interference—unlike Bluetooth alternatives.

**Made for Smartphones (and More)**  
Unlike many pro mics that require extra dongles, the Wireless ME comes with **three cables**: USB-C, Lightning, and TRS. Whether you’re using an iPhone, Android, or DSLR, you’re covered.
