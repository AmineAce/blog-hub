Why Youâ€™ll Love the RÃ˜DE Wireless ME

**Crystal-Clear Audio**  
With a high-quality omnidirectional mic capsule and 24-bit/48kHz digital transmission, the Wireless ME captures rich, detailed sound while minimizing background noise. Perfect for outdoor shoots, indoor interviews, or even voiceovers.

**Compact & Camera-Mountable**  
Both the transmitter and receiver are lightweight and small enough to clip onto a lapel, bag strap, or camera hot shoe. The included foam windscreen helps reduce wind noise, making it ideal for on-the-move filming.

**Long Battery Life & Secure Connection**  
Enjoy up to 7 hours of continuous use on a single charge, and a stable wireless range of up to 200 meters (line of sight). The secure digital connection ensures no dropouts or interferenceâ€”unlike Bluetooth alternatives.
