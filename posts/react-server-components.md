# Understanding React Server Components

React Server Components (RSC) represent a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. They allow us to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle sent to the client.

## What Are Server Components?

Server Components are React components that run exclusively on the server. They never ship JavaScript to the client, making your application faster and more efficient.

### Key Advantages

- **Zero Bundle Size**: Server Components don't add to your JavaScript bundle
- **Direct Backend Access**: Access databases and APIs directly
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Only client components are bundled
- **Improved Performance**: Faster initial page loads

## Server vs Client Components

Understanding when to use each type is crucial:

### Server Components (Default)

Use for:
- Data fetching
- Accessing backend resources
- Keeping sensitive information on the server
- Reducing client-side JavaScript

### Client Components

Use for:
- Interactivity and event listeners
- Browser-only APIs
- State and lifecycle effects
- Custom hooks

## Example: Fetching Data

Here's how you fetch data in a Server Component:

\`\`\`tsx
async function BlogPost({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const post = await db.post.findUnique({ where: { id } })
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  )
}
\`\`\`

No `useEffect`, no loading states, no client-side fetching libraries needed!

## Composition Patterns

You can compose Server and Client Components together:

\`\`\`tsx
// Server Component
import ClientButton from './client-button'

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetchData()
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <ClientButton />
    </div>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Server Components as the default**: Only use 'use client' when necessary
2. **Move Client Components down the tree**: Minimize client-side JavaScript
3. **Pass serializable props**: Server to Client component props must be serializable
4. **Leverage streaming**: Use Suspense for progressive rendering

## The Future of React

React Server Components are not just a featureâ€”they're the future of React development. They enable us to build faster, more efficient applications while maintaining the developer experience we love.

As the ecosystem matures, we'll see more patterns and best practices emerge. Now is the perfect time to start learning and experimenting with RSC in your projects.
